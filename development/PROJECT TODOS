*** TODOs ***

---Functionality Stuff ---

    -use currentEvent to data-bind to more info DIV, click on list view event pops up more info, more info has link to click on map marker

    -handle api (and other errors?) gracefully

    -event refresh button or auto-refresh when map moves a certain distance

---View/Design Stuff---
    -fix panning/centering on to map marker
    -event info display (make html content)
        -infoWindow
        -list view

        -change google info windows to just data-bind info from currentVenue (then maybe can highlight currentEvent)?

        currentEvent info display:
            -show title
            -formatted time (make formatted time subobject for lastFmEvents)
            -artist list (click on artist brings up another info display or links to last.fm)
            -show description (if applicable)
            -show tags? (click tag to search for that tag)
            -venue (click shows currentVenue info display)
            -link to last fm event page and/or website

        currentVenue(make this observable variable) info display:
            -name
            -address/phone#
            -list of concerts (click on one pops up currentEvent info display)
            -link to website and/or last fm page
            -four square or other info (to include another API)
            -image? (responsiveness issues)

        currentArtist
            -name
            -genre tag
            -upcoming shows
            -youtube search results (another API)
            -link to last fm page/website


---Code Quality Stuff---

    -refactor CSS to use one media query?

    -organize code and comments


Extra/Nice to have stuff:
********************

-auto set map bounds based on markers?
-more info(in markers and list view): open info window style pop up(but not actually an info window)
    -large box, displays lots of additional info, including from other APIs
********************
-click on list item--> change CSS for that event in venue's infoWindow display
-search display
    when search box is selected (cursor is inside form for typing) display search field selection
    (i.e. all, artist, tags, venue, street/address, etc.)
-list view
    -can view by event/artist, venue, tags
    -how to handle multiple events by same artist? (at same venue, different venues?) -->or just handle with different
        list views
-instead of limiting results from last.fm, base request on map bounds (within reason?)
-search autocomplete (display possible matches underneath (would need an additional function))
