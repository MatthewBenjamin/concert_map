*** TODOs ***


***DOES DATA-BINDING IN INFO WINDOWS ALWAYS WORK CORRECTLY?***
-------->NO: nothing displays when location changes
            currentVenue() has correct object, maybe infoWindows' html content aren't getting filled when location changes?

Refactor app.js

check how currentEvent/Venue/Artist is called

---Functionality Stuff ---
    -handle api (and other errors?) gracefully (timeout is way too long atm)


---View/Design Stuff---
    -fix panning/centering on to map marker
    -parse event time in parse LastFm data function & display as desired, time is displayed in:
        -list view, event-info, infoWindow, (add to venue-info?)

        -CSS/Design extra-info displays
            -TO DO:
                -handle if data is empty
                -close 'X' button sometimes lies on top of titles
                -have close button and title not move when scrolling (put in a header div)
    -click on tag to search in extra-info closes extra-info and opens list view

---Code Quality Stuff---

    -refactor CSS to use one media query?

    -organize code and comments


Extra/Nice to have stuff:
********************
-store last.fm artist, youtube API and 4square data to lastFm object for caching purposes
-event refresh button or auto-refresh when map moves a certain distance?
-auto set map bounds based on markers?
-more info(in markers and list view): open info window style pop up(but not actually an info window)
    -large box, displays lots of additional info, including from other APIs
********************
-click on list item--> change CSS for that event in venue's infoWindow display
-search display
    when search box is selected (cursor is inside form for typing) display search field selection
    (i.e. all, artist, tags, venue, street/address, etc.)
-list view
    -can view by event/artist, venue, tags
    -how to handle multiple events by same artist? (at same venue, different venues?) -->or just handle with different
        list views
-instead of limiting results from last.fm, base request on map bounds (within reason?)
-search autocomplete (display possible matches underneath (would need an additional function))
-add intro how-to app tour
