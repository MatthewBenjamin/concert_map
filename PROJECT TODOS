*** TODOs ***

---Functionality Stuff ---

    -use currentEvent to data-bind to more info DIV, click on list view event pops up more info, more info has link to click on map marker

    -add self.currentEvent observable to ViewModel and data bind concerts to infoWindows? but needs default display if just clicking on a map marker and not a specific concert in list view

    -handle api (and other errors?) gracefully

    -event refresh button or auto-refresh when map moves a certain distance
---View/Design Stuff---

    -event info display (make html content)
        -infoWindow
        -list view
---Code Quality Stuff---

    -refactor CSS to use one media query?

    -organize code and comments


Extra/Nice to have stuff:
********************

-pan to map marker (center it)
-auto set map bounds based on markers?
-more info(in markers and list view): open info window style pop up(but not actually an info window)
    -large box, displays lots of additional info, including from other APIs
********************
-click on list item--> change CSS for that event in venue's infoWindow display
-search display
    when search box is selected (cursor is inside form for typing) display search field selection
    (i.e. all, artist, tags, venue, street/address, etc.)
-list view
    -can view by event/artist, venue, tags
    -how to handle multiple events by same artist? (at same venue, different venues?) -->or just handle with different
        list views
-instead of limiting results from last.fm, base request on map bounds (within reason?)
-search autocomplete (display possible matches underneath (would need an additional function))
