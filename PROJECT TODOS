*** TODOs ***

-fix List menu implementation (for medium screen esp).
    -2 boolean variables?

-event info display (make html content)
    -infoWindow
    -list view

-handle api (and other errors?) gracefully
-event refresh button or auto-refresh when map moves a certain distance

-organize code and comments

Extra/Nice to have stuff:
********************

-pan to map marker (center it)
-auto set map bounds based on markers?
-more info(in markers and list view): open info window style pop up(but not actually an info window)
    -large box, displays lots of additional info, including from other APIs
********************
-click on list item--> change CSS for that event in venue's infoWindow display
-search display
    when search box is selected (cursor is inside form for typing) display search field selection
    (i.e. all, artist, tags, venue, street/address, etc.)
-list view
    -can view by event/artist, venue, tags
    -how to handle multiple events by same artist? (at same venue, different venues?) -->or just handle with different
        list views
-instead of limiting results from last.fm, base request on map bounds (within reason?)
-search autocomplete (display possible matches underneath (would need an additional function))
